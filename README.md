Watchlist app

Current iteration of app used for tracking movies that you want to watch in the future.  Uses IMDB database to pull movie list and allows users to add and delete movies from their watchlist.  Will update readme when api has been deployed with more specifics, at the moment just working on getting a static client to build api around before adding additional features and proper stylizing.
